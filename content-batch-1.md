Each cigar is hand-selected for the occasion - tonight we're featuring our Dominican Reserve collection alongside some rare Cuban alternatives. The leather humidor travel case keeps everything at perfect humidity even during transport.

Using a proper cigar cutter (like this guillotine style) gives you:
‚Ä¢ Clean, even burn
‚Ä¢ Perfect draw resistance  
‚Ä¢ No bitter tobacco bits
‚Ä¢ Professional presentation

Whether you're at a Renaissance Faire or a corporate gala, proper technique shows respect for the craft!

"‚öîÔ∏è TOBACCO IN THE RENAISSANCE ‚öîÔ∏è

Did you know tobacco arrived in Europe around 1560? While it didn't make it to most Renaissance Faires historically, it became a luxury item among nobility by the late 1500s!

At Faire, we offer period-appropriate alternatives and educate visitors about tobacco's fascinating journey from the New World to European courts. Our 'Royal Blend' pays homage to those early luxury tobacco experiences. üëë

Fun fact: My ADHD hyperfocus has led me down SO many historical rabbit holes about tobacco trade routes! üß†‚ú®

"ü•É PAIRING PERFECTION: Cigars & Whiskey ü•É

The RIGHT pairing enhances both the cigar AND the drink. Here's my go-to formula:

‚Ä¢ Light cigars ‚Üí Lighter whiskeys (Irish, wheated bourbon)
‚Ä¢ Medium cigars ‚Üí Classic bourbon, aged rum
‚Ä¢ Full-bodied cigars ‚Üí Peated Scotch, barrel-proof bourbon

Pro tip: The tannins in tobacco interact with alcohol similarly to wine pairings. Think complementary, not competing flavors!

This knowledge serves me whether I'm consulting for a corporate whiskey tasting or helping Renaissance Faire visitors understand period drinking customs. üè∞

"üì∏ VENUE SPOTLIGHT: The Grand Ballroom

Some spaces just CALL for premium cigars. The marble columns, crystal chandeliers, and Art Deco details create the perfect backdrop for an elevated smoking experience.

Our team worked with the event planner to create designated cigar areas that complemented the venue's elegance. Custom ashtrays, proper ventilation coordination, and white-glove service throughout the evening.

Architecture and atmosphere matter - that's why we do site visits for every major event. üèõÔ∏è‚ú®
