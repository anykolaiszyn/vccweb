excerpt: "Being diagnosed with ADHD and autism in my 40s didn't just explain my past—it revealed my competitive advantage in the tobacco industry."

I spent 42 years thinking I was just "intense" about things I cared about. Turns out, there's a word for that—hyperfocus. And it's exactly why Vice City Cigars offers a different level of expertise than your typical mobile cigar service.

## The Revelation

When I was diagnosed with ADHD and autism at 42, my first thought wasn't "Oh no." It was "Oh, THAT'S why I spend three hours researching the terroir differences between Nicaraguan tobacco farms when I'm supposed to be doing inventory."

My brain doesn't do things halfway. When I got serious about cigars and pipes, I didn't just learn about them—I *studied* them. Wrapper leaf characteristics. Fermentation processes. The difference between Connecticut Shade and Connecticut Broadleaf. How altitude affects flavor development. The traditional methods used in Davidoff's factory versus the innovations at Drew Estate.

## The Neurodivergent Advantage in Tobacco

### Pattern Recognition = Perfect Pairings
My autistic brain naturally spots patterns that others miss. I can tell within minutes of talking to someone whether they'll love a mild Connecticut wrapper or need the complexity of a Nicaraguan puro. It's not magic—it's pattern recognition applied to flavor preferences, personality types, and smoking experience.

### Hyperfocus = Quality Obsession
When neurotypical business owners say "good enough," my ADHD brain says "but what if we could make it perfect?" Every cigar in my mobile humidor earned its place through obsessive research. I don't stock something because it has good margins—I stock it because it's exceptional for its category.

### Systematic Thinking = Consistent Excellence
Autism loves systems, and exceptional tobacco service requires systems. My event setup follows the same tested procedures every time. My product selection process has specific criteria. My customer interaction approach adapts to the individual while maintaining consistent quality standards.

## What This Means for Your Event

### No Pretentious BS
I don't do "tobacco industry theater." No condescending lectures about how you're holding your cigar wrong. No gatekeeping about what you "should" like. If you want to pair a premium Padron with a Corona beer instead of aged rum, I'll tell you why that actually works.

### Genuine Expertise
When I recommend a cigar, it's because I've researched its farm, studied its blend, and probably obsessed over its flavor profile for longer than most people think about their lunch. This isn't sales—it's sharing genuine enthusiasm.

### Accommodating Different Needs
Social situations can be tricky for everyone, not just neurodivergent folks. I get it if you need:
- Detailed information before making decisions
- Time to process options without pressure
- Clear explanations without assumptions
- Quiet space away from the crowd
- The same question answered multiple times

## The Renaissance Fair Connection

My neurodivergent traits align perfectly with Renaissance Fair culture. The deep appreciation for craftsmanship, attention to historical detail, and genuine enthusiasm for sharing specialized knowledge—that's my natural operating mode.

At Camelot Days, you'll find me in period-appropriate attire, discussing 16th-century tobacco varieties with the same intensity I bring to modern boutique cigars. Because whether it's historical accuracy or flavor profiling, my brain doesn't know how to do things superficially.

## Building a Different Kind of Business

Traditional business advice says "fake it till you make it." Neurodivergent business ownership says "use your authentic intensity as your competitive advantage."

I'm not trying to be the biggest mobile cigar service in South Florida. I'm trying to be the most genuinely excellent one. That means:
- Obsessive quality curation
- Systematic service delivery
- Honest, clear communication
- Accommodation for different comfort levels
- Deep expertise freely shared

## For Other Late-Diagnosed Entrepreneurs

If you're reading this and thinking "that sounds familiar," you might want to explore whether you're neurodivergent too. Late diagnosis is incredibly common, especially for people who've learned to mask their differences.

Your "overthinking" might be your superpower. Your need for systems might be your quality advantage. Your intense interests might be your expertise edge.

The tobacco industry—like many traditional industries—needs more authentic voices and different perspectives. Your neurodivergent traits aren't obstacles to overcome; they're advantages to leverage.

## The Bottom Line

Being neurodivergent doesn't make me a better person, but it absolutely makes me a better tobacco curator. My ADHD hyperfocus and autistic attention to detail create a level of product knowledge and service consistency that you simply can't get from someone who treats cigars as just another product to sell.

When you book Vice City Cigars, you're not just getting a mobile smoking service. You're getting someone who has literally spent hundreds of hours researching the perfect cigars for your event because that's how my brain works—and I wouldn't have it any other way.
