If you’re new to cigars, welcome! Here’s a quick guide to help you choose your first smoke and enjoy the experience.

## Start Mild
Look for a mild or medium-bodied cigar—these are creamy, nutty, and easygoing. Ask for a Connecticut wrapper or a classic Robusto size.

## Don’t Overthink Size
Robusto, Toro, or Corona are all great for beginners. They’re not too long or too strong.

## Ask for Recommendations
Our team loves helping beginners! Tell us what flavors you like (coffee, chocolate, nuts?) and we’ll suggest a perfect match.

## Enjoy the Ritual
Cut, light, and savor slowly. Pair with coffee or a mild whiskey for a classic combo.
