There's something magical about stepping into a Renaissance Fair. The costumes, the craftsmanship, the artisan booths—it's like traveling back in time. And for us at Vice City Cigars, it's the perfect setting to showcase the timeless art of pipe smoking and premium tobacco.

## Our Renaissance Fair Journey

When we first started appearing at Renaissance Fairs, we knew we had to do it right. No modern displays or tropical decorations here—we go full period-appropriate with our booth setup. Think wooden displays, traditional signage, and an atmosphere that honors the centuries-old tradition of pipe smoking.

### Camelot Days: Our Home Away From Home

[Camelot Days](https://camelotdays.com/) in Pompano Beach has become our favorite event of the year. The fair attracts serious enthusiasts—people who appreciate craftsmanship, history, and quality. It's where our pipe tobacco really shines.

## What Makes Renaissance Fair Customers Special

Renaissance Fair attendees are different from our typical South Florida event clients. They're:

- **Artisan Appreciators:** They understand quality craftsmanship
- **History Buffs:** They love the stories behind products
- **Pipe Enthusiasts:** Many are already experienced pipe smokers
- **Community-Focused:** They value authentic connections

## Our Fair-Specific Approach

### Traditional Blends
We bring tobacco blends that would feel at home in any century—rich, earthy, and complex. No fruity modern flavors here, just the timeless tastes that pipe smokers have enjoyed for generations.

### Artisan Pipes
Our Renaissance Fair selection focuses on classic shapes and traditional craftsmanship. Straight-grain briars, classic billiards, and handcrafted pieces that look like they belong in the hands of a medieval craftsman.

### Educational Experience
Fair-goers love to learn. We share the history of tobacco, pipe-making traditions, and the cultural significance of smoking throughout history.

## Looking Ahead: Florida Renaissance Festival 2026

We're thrilled to announce we've been invited back to the Florida Renaissance Festival in 2026! After taking some time away, we're excited to return with an even better booth and expanded selection.
